# TrafficFlow Notebook

This project involves analyzing and modeling traffic flow using data from the `Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv` dataset. The notebook utilizes data science and machine learning techniques to understand patterns in traffic volume and make predictions.

## Features

* **Data Loading and Exploration:**
  - Reads traffic volume data from a CSV file.
  - Parses timestamps and sets them as the index for time-series analysis.
* **Data Visualization:**
  - Employs Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  - Visualizes trends, distributions, and correlations within the dataset.
* **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:**
  - Cleans the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
  - Extracts temporal features like hour, day, and month from timestamps.
* **Model Development:**
  - Builds predictive models using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - Utilizes layers like Dense, Dropout, and others for deep learning.
  - Implements callbacks for efficient training.

## Dependencies

The notebook uses the following libraries:

* Python (>=3.7)
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* TensorFlow (>=2.x)
* IPython

## Dataset

The dataset, `Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv`, contains traffic volume data with features such as:

* `date_time`: Timestamp of the observation.
* `holiday`: Whether the day is a holiday.
* `temp`: Temperature during the observation.
* Other relevant traffic-related features.

## Usage

1. **Setup:**
   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`TrafficFlow.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.
   - Execute cells sequentially to load data, preprocess, analyze, and train models.

3. **Results:**

### Test Results

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0302
